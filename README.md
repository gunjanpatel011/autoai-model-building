# autoai-model-building
AutoAI in IBM Watson Studio is an automated machine learning tool that simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying high-quality machine learning models with minimal manual effort. It automatically analyzes datasets, performs data preprocessing, selects the best algorithms, and optimizes multiple model pipelines. AutoAI evaluates these pipelines based on metrics like accuracy or RMSE and ranks them to help users choose the best model. It also provides visual insights into feature importance and allows easy model deployment as REST APIs. This makes it especially useful for users with limited data science expertise, enabling faster and smarter model development.
